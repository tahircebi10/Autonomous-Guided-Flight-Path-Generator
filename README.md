# Autonomous Guided Flight Path Generator
 This project is designed to autonomously navigate an Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) to a specified target location. It leverages the MAVLink protocol for communication, dynamically calculates the flight path, visualizes it in real-time, and executes the mission.
